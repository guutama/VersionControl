Version control systems are tools that are used to keep track of changes to source code or other collections of files and folder. As the name implies this tools help track the history of changes to some set of dokuments. In addition to doing that they facilitete colabration. So they are really useful to work with group of people on a software project. <br/>

Version control systems track change of folders and its content in series of snapshots. So you capture entire state of a folder and everything inside and you have multiple of this <br/>

Version control system maintain a bunch of metadata along with actual changes to the content,like authers, commit times,messages . This is to make it possible to figure out tings like **Who authered a particular change to a particular file?**, or **When was the particular change is made?** <br/>

# Why is version control system useful
Version control system is useful even when you work on a projekt by your selv. Use  it to figure out old version of code you have written and figure out why something was changed by looking at the commit messages.  You can work on different tings in parallell without any conflict by using different branches of developmen or be able towork on bug fixes while working on different features independantly. So its invaluable tool even if you are working by your self on small scale project.  <br/>

Ofcource version control system is a powerful tool woring with other people, its useful for sending patches of codes around,  resolving conflicts when different people working on the same piece of code at the same time. 

It  also hat a neat functionality to let you answer questions that would otherwise will be hard to answer,like who wrote a particular module on a software project, who edited a particular line on a particular software project, why was this particular line was changed when it was changed, by whom. 

Suppose you have been working a project for a couple of years, and you notiched some thing was broken in the code,it wasnt broken just now it was broken sometimes ago and you dont know exacty when. Version control system have a way of automatically identifying this. It can binary search your history and figure out exactly what happened and when it happened. 

# Git 
There are number of version control systems out there but Git has become the defacto standerd for version control. 

Git has an ugly interface but its underlying design and idea is actually beautifull. The

Trees are folders and blobs are files. Trees can contain other trees and blobs
